Feature: Authentication

  Scenario: Spoofing - Prevent unauthorized users from impersonating legitimate users
    Given a user has registered with a valid email and password
    When the user attempts to log in with an incorrect email or password
    Then the system should not authenticate the user
    And the system should require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security

  Scenario: Tampering - Prevent modification of data during transmission
    Given a user is logged into the app
    When the user submits authentication credentials
    Then the credentials should be transmitted securely using HTTPS (SSL/TLS)
    And passwords should be encrypted before being stored in the database

  Scenario: Repudiation - Ensure that actions cannot be denied
    Given a user performs a critical action, like signing up or signing in
    When the action is completed
    Then the system should log the user's action with a timestamp
    And the log should be stored securely to prevent tampering

  Scenario: Information Disclosure - Prevent sensitive information from being leaked
    Given a user is interacting with the app
    When an error occurs
    Then the system should not display detailed error messages to the user
    And sensitive user data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest

  Scenario: Denial of Service (DoS) - Prevent excessive requests from overwhelming the system
    Given a user is attempting to authenticate with the app
    When the user repeatedly attempts to log in with incorrect credentials
    Then the system should lock the user out after a predefined number of failed attempts
    And the system should rate limit login requests to avoid DoS attacks

  Scenario: Elevation of Privilege - Ensure unauthorized access is not granted
    Given a user is logged in with a basic user account
    When the user attempts to access a restricted feature
    Then the system should deny access based on their role and permissions
    And the system should enforce least privilege access via Firebase Firestore rules

  Scenario: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Prevent malicious script injection
    Given a user is entering data into a sign-up form
    When the user submits a form with potentially malicious JavaScript code
    Then the system should sanitize the input and escape any scripts
    And the form should not allow the execution of injected scripts

  Scenario: Credential Stuffing - Prevent unauthorized access from using stolen credentials
    Given a user attempts to log in with their credentials
    When multiple failed login attempts occur from different IP addresses or locations
    Then the system should trigger CAPTCHA to verify the legitimacy of the login attempt
    And the system should lock the account after multiple failed login attempts
